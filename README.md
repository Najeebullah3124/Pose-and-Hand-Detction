# 🧍‍♀️ Pose and Hand Estimation 🖐️

This Python project uses **MediaPipe** for real-time **pose estimation** and **hand tracking**. The script captures video from the webcam and processes the frames to detect and visualize **body pose** and **hand gestures** simultaneously. The program provides real-time feedback by drawing pose landmarks and hand landmarks on the video feed. 🤖🎥
